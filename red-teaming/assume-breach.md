# Assume Breach

Assume Breach is a [[planning-an-engagement#4 Breach Model|breach model]] in which the organization provides the red team its initial access.

The purpose of a red team engagement is to test the organization's ability to detect and respond to adversarial actions, not its ability to prevent them from happening altogether. Thus, most red team engagement's follow this breach model in order to maximize the effectiveness of the engagement.
