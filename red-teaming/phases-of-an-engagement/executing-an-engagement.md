# Executing an Offensive Engagement

---

## Phases

### 1. External Reconnaissance

Research is done on the target in order to understand it better. Some of the useful information:

- Public-facing applications
- IP ranges
- Domain names
- Technologies and products used
- Employees
- Organizational structure
- Service providers
- Suppliers

### 2. Foothold

1. Synthesize the information gathered in step #1 to plan and execute an attack on the perimeter and gain a foothold in the target environment
2. Immediately establish persistence on the foothold

### 3. Internal Reconnaissance

With a persistent foothold established in the target environment, seek to understand its structure. Some useful information here:

- Network topology
- Internal systems & processes
- Defensive products & capabilities

### 4. Lateral Movement

Synthesize the infromation gathered in step #3 to develop a plan for achieving the objective, which will likely require some form of lateral movement

### 5. Achieve the Objective

Once you have achieved the objective, take an appropriate level of evidence.
