# Operations Security (OPSEC)

---

## What is OPSEC?

Originally coined by the US military, OPSEC is generally described as the "ease" by which one's actions can be observed by "enemy" intelligence.

From a red team's perspective, OPSEC is the "ease" by which its actions can be observed by the blue team. However, it doesn't just work in one direction. Both sides are trying to observe the other and adjust their actions accordingly. Thus, a red team can exploit a blue team's lack of OPSEC by gaining access to their SIEM, ticketing, email, or chat systems and leveraging that access to inform their actions.

## Good Practices

- Always assume your actions are being monitored and can be disrupted by the enemy
- Unless you know *for a fact* otherwise, assume your enemy is more capable than you
