## Target Familiarization

1. Read through the target's website and other publications to understand:
	- What do they do?
	- Why do they do it?
	- How do they do it?
	- Where do they do it?
	- How long have they been doing it?
2. Based on the target's website, how do they communicate?
	- What languages do they speak in? What's their primary?
	- What tone do they use? Are they strictly professional or more laid back?
	- How does the target's location affect the way they communicate?
		- What's going on in the target's location? Will this affect the way they communicate? Can relating to current events be used to establish rapport?

## Domain Name Research

Using a [[dns#Commercial Domain Name Services|domain name service]], determine available domain names that are *similar* to the target's domain name(s).

Some techniques for this:

### TLD Variation

Registering the same domain with a different top-level domain (TLD). For example, if your target is `youtube.com`, you register the domain `youtube.net`.

### Unicode Character Variation

Registering a domain containing [Unicode characters](https://altcodeunicode.com/) that are similar but different to those in your target's domain name. For example, if your target is `youtube.com`, you register the domain `youtubÃª.com`.

### ASCII Character Variation

Registering a domain containing ASCII characters that look similar but are different from those in your traget's domain name. For example, if your target is `iglo.com`, you register the domain `igIo.com`.
