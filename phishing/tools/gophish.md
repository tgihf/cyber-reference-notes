## Web Application Interface

![[Pasted image 20220131151803.png]]

`GoPhish`'s web interface is pretty intuitive. A couple of notes about some of the options:

### Landing Pages

These are static web pages whose links can be embedded directly into the phishing emails you send out. When users click these links, they'll land on these pages.

`GoPhish`'s landing pages are static. Use [[evilginx2]] as a more sophisticated man-in-the-middle-based approach to capturing a user's credentials.

### Sending Profiles

Who the email is going to be coming from.
