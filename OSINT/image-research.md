## Reverse Image Searching

Give the search engine an image and have it return relevant results (pages tied to the photo, similar photos, etc.).

Possible reverse image search engines:

- [Google Image Searching](https://images.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl)
	- Returns exact photo matches
	- Returns pages tied to the photo
- [Yandex Image Searching](https://yandex.com/images/)
	- Returns similar photos
- [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)

## Viewing Exif Data

**Exif** is the Exchangeable Image File Format, a standard that specifies the formats for images, sounds, and ancilliary tags used by digital cameras, scanners, and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras.

The **Exif** format specifies all kinds of useful metadata about the file that can be useful to a researcher:

- Capturing device type (i.e., iPhone 4s)
- Timestamp
- Geocoordinates
- Author name
- Username
- and more
