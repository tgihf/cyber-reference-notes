## Reverse Image Searching

Give the search engine an image and have it return relevant results (pages tied to the photo, similar photos, etc.).

A few reverse image search engines:

- [PimEyes](https://pimeyes.com/en)
	- Requires an account, but very effective
- [Google Image Searching](https://images.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl)
- [Yandex Image Searching](https://yandex.com/images/)
- [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)

## Viewing Exif Data

**Exif** is the Exchangeable Image File Format, a standard that specifies the formats for images, sounds, and ancilliary tags used by digital cameras, scanners, and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras.

The **Exif** format specifies all kinds of useful metadata about the file that can be useful to a researcher:

- Capturing device type (i.e., iPhone 4s)
- Timestamp
- Geocoordinates
- Author name
- Username
- and more

### Exif Data Parsing Tools

#### Command Line

- [[exiftool#View a File's Exif Data|exiftool]]

#### Web Applications

- [Jeffrey's Image Metadata Viewer](http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi)

## Identifying an Image's Location (by hand, no Exif data)

Analyze the image's details to narrow down its potential location.

- Use a [[search-engines|search engine]] to lookup any unique building signs.
- [[image-research#Reverse Image Searching|Reverse image search]] any buildings or landmarks that stand out.
- [This article](https://somerandomstuff1.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/geoguessr-the-top-tips-tricks-and-techniques/) is a great resource for exactly what details you should be looking at and how those details indicate different areas of the world.

[GeoGuesser](https://www.geoguessr.com/) is an online game that lets you test this skill.
