## Discovering Birthdays

If you have someone's name, username, or email address and want to find out their birthday, use various [[search-engines#List of Search Engines|search engines]] and [[search-engines#Search Engine Operators|their operators]] to find their birthday explicitly or perhaps a social media post from someone wishing them a happy birthday.

Birthdays are common in weak passwords. This information could be used when crafting a targeted password attack.
