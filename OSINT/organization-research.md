## Researching an Organization's Employees

Visit the organization's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) page and view its `People`. This displays a list of cards, some of which may or may not contain information about each employee. You can [[image-research#Reverse Image Searching|reverse image search]] their card's photo or use a [[search-engines|search engine]] to search their exact job title at the organization (i.e., `"Senior IT Administrator at TCM Security" site:linkedin.com`) in an attempt to find the employee's actual LinkedIn page.
