## Description

U2F is a 2FA protocol in which a physical hardware token is plugged into the USB port of the user's computer. When a user attempts to log into a website, they will be prompted to click a button or enter a code from the U2F device. The device communicates directly to the website using the browser as a communication channel.

The U2F protocol is designed to take the website's domain name as one of the key components in negotiating the handshake. This makes U2F a powerful mitigation technique against more sophisticated phishing techniques, like that employed by [[evilginx2]].
