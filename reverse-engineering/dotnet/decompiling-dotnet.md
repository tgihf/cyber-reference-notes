# Decompiling .NET Binaries

Use [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) to decompile a .NET binary into its source code.

It's a Windows executable, so open it on a Windows computer or with `wine` on a Linux computer.

Navigate to `File` > `Open` and select the .NET binary file you'd like to decompile and BOOM, you're off!
