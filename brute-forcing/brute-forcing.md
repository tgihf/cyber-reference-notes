# Brute Forcing

> The process of iterating through a keyspace and/or dictionary in an attempt to perform some action to gain information or access. This can take many forms, such as fuzzing web application URIs to discover content, fuzzing a web application login form to enumerate usernames, fuzzing an SSH server with credentials in an attempt to gain access, or cracking a password hash.
