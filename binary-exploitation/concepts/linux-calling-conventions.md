# Calling Conventions in Linux

The convention for calling functions in 32-bit Linux assembly differs from the calling convention in 64-bit Linux assembly.

## 32-Bit Calling Convention

First, arguments are placed in the **stack** in **reverse order**.

When the function is called, the return address is then placed on the **stack**.

For example, say you want to execute the function `execl("/bin/bash", "bash"`). Say the address of the `execl` function is `0x00000009`, the address of the string `/bin/bash` is `0x0000000a`, the address of the string `bash` is `0x0000000b`.

You'd start by pushing the arguments on the stack in reverse order, starting with the address of the string `bash`, `0x0000000b`. Then you'd push the address of the string `/bin/bash`, `0x0000000a`. Then you'd call `execl`.

| Address | Instruction |
| --- | --- |
| 0x20 | `push 0x0000000b` |
| 0x24 | `push 0x0000000a` |
| 0x28 | `call 0x00000009` |
| 0x2c | `nop` |

At the moment you entered `execl`, some of the registers would look like:

```txt
EIP  = 0x00000009 (address of execl)
ESP -> 0x0000002c (return address)
    -> 0x0000000a (address of /bin/bash string)
	-> 0x0000000b (address of bash string)
```
