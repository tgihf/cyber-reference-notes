# CVE-2021-1675

> A vulnerability that allows remote code execution as `SYSTEM` on any unpatched computer running the **Windows Print Spooler service**. Similar but distinct from [[CVE-2021-34527-print-nightmare|CVE-2021-34527, the Print Nightmare vulnerability]]. There has been much confusion in the community between the two vulnerabilities. Most of the proofs of concepts are for 34527, so if the Print Spooler service is running on a target computer, go with that one.
