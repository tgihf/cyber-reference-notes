# Windows Kernel Exploits

> The Windows Kernel is a software system that facilitates efficient and secure communication between software processes and hardware devices.

## Process

The process of successfully exploiting a known-vulnerable Windows kernel involves three steps:

1. Determine the target's operating system version and installed updates
2. Research kernel exploits that target that version with those installed updates
3. Evaluate, rank, and launch discovered exploits

---

## 1. Determine the Target's Operating System Version & Installed Updates

This should be accomplished during [[windows-situational-awareness|situational awareness]]. If it wasn't, note down the following:

- [[windows-situational-awareness#Operating System Information|Operating system version]]
-  [[windows-situational-awareness#Installed Updates Hotfixes|Installed updates]]

## 2. Research Kernel Exploits

- [[windows-exploit-suggester]]
- Meterpreter's exploit suggester
- [Windows Kernel Exploits Repository](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits)
- Google
- `searchsploit`

## 3. Evaluate, Rank, & Launch Exploits

**Evaluate** the exploits you've discovered during your research. Some things to keep in mind:

- You don't have to understand what they're doing at a nitty-gritty level, but you should understand the conditions upon which each one depends and whether or not your current situation meets those conditions
- Ensure the exploit meets your objective--if you're trying to escalate privileges, ensure that the exploit does this (not all kernel exploits do)

Once you've evaluated the exploits and confirmed they are appropriate for the current situation, **rank** them in order of probability of success based on what you've learned.

**Launch** each exploit at the target until you've achieved your objective. Some things to keep in mind:

- If the exploit must be compiled, it is ideal to compile it on the target machine or on a machine with the same kernel and operating system
	- Before transferring the exploit to the target, ensure it at least has the necessary compiler
- Make sure you understand the basic functionality of each exploit
- Clean up any artifacts the exploit may leave behind
