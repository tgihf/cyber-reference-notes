# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows users to run a GNU/Linux environment--inculding most command-line tools, utilities, and applications--directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualbool setup.

WSL version 1 was released in 2016 and version 2, a major update, was released in 2019.
