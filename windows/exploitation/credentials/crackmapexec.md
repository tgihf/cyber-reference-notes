"A swiss army knife for pentesting networks." Especially useful for Active Directory environments.

## Pass a domain credential to a target to check for access

* $TARGET:
  * Hostname
  * IP address
  * CIDR range
* $USERNAME
  * Single username
  * File of usernames, one per line
* $PASSWORD
  * Single password
  * File of passwords, one per line
* $DOMAIN
  * Active Directory domain name

```bash
crackmapexec smb $TARGET -d $DOMAIN -u $USERNAME -p $PASSWORD
```

* A successful credential pair will be highlighted in **green**
* A successful credential pair that also has remote access (via wmiexec, evil-winrm, etc.) will be highlighted in **green** and designated ***Pwned***

## Pass a local credential to a target to check for access

* $TARGET:
  * Hostname
  * IP address
  * CIDR range
* $USERNAME
